Description:
--------------
- Using the React framework, I built a minimal, clean and easy-to-use to-do web app that keeps track of your tasks and stores them in the browser's memory.
- The web application features a 'Task' area where the user can enter the task which they want the application to save, and can then use the checkbox to cross-out the task. To delete the task from the to-do list, the user can simply click the 'X' icon.
- Live demo: https://pathumd.github.io/todo-list/

Tools used:
--------------
- React (JavaScript)
- HTML
- CSS
